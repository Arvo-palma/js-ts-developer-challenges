# Dynamox Front-end Developer Challenge

[< back to README](./README.md)

In order to contribute to the enhancement of our platform, DynaPredict, we present you with the following challenge: 

Develop a robust and intuitive dashboard application using React and TypeScript. To help you, we provide a figma layout and other requirements.

While going through the challenge, you should be able to demonstrate problem-solving skills and adhere to best practices in development. Effective communication through code quality, readability, maintainability and documentation will also be evaluated.

## User Stories and Functional Requirements

Here you have the functional requirements for the application. Use it as a guide to develop the application features: You are free to make any assumptions you consider necessary to complete the challenge.

It is not mandatory to implement all the listed requirements before submitting your implementation. Just keep in mind that the more requirements you implement, the more resources we will have to assess your skills and knowledge.

We expect candidates applying to more senior levels to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the requirements and to implement more of them for the same deadline.

1 - Data Stories

1. [ ] Mock your back-end using a package like [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
1. [ ] The fake REST API, should deliver the data available in (./response.json).

2 - Front-end stories
1. [ ] Build an interface following our [figma design](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
1. [ ] Develop an integrated cursor as i hover through the plots.

3 - Technical requirements

1. [ ] Use TypeScript.
1. [ ] Use React.
1. [ ] Use Redux for managing global states. [Check out](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Redux Saga for asynchronous side effects. [Check out](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/introduction/GettingStarted) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Vite for building the app.[Check out](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Material UI 5 for styling the application. [Check out](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Highcharts to display the plots. [Check out](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/index) to get started.

We encourage using our stack tools to make the challenge resemble your everyday tasks. The choice of remaining tools is at your discretion.
