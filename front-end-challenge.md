# Dynamox Front-end Developer Challenge

[< back to README](./README.md)

Dynamox front-end development team presents you with the following challenge:

**Using React and TypeScript, develop a robust and intuitive dashboard application to assess the data acquired by our sensor.**

---

Keep in mind the challenge aims to reproduce an environament where you could demonstrate your skills. 

In order to help guiding your development process we will provide some requirements. It is not mandatory to implement all the listed requirements to submit your implementation. The more requirements you implement, the more resources we will have to assess your skills and knowledge. 

Use your best judgement to prioritize tasks to meet the time you have available. Feel free to make any assumptions you consider necessary to complete the task.

## Stories and Functional Requirements

In maintenance industry, vibration analysis plays a main role. These technique uses physical quantities like acceleration, velocity and diplacement to find evidences that help predict occurence of faults or degradations in machines. 

The page that displays this information in Dynapredict, the asset condition monitoring platform of Dynamox, is vital and holds a design pretty much like [these](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

1 - Data Stories
1. [ ] Use the data available in (./response.json) as a model for the responses. Mock your back-end using a package like [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

2 - Front-end stories
1. [ ] Plot Build an interface following our [figma design](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
1. [ ] Develop an integrated cursor as i hover through the plots.

3 - Technical requirements
We encourage using our stack tools to make the challenge resemble your everyday tasks. The choice of remaining tools is at your discretion.

1. [ ] Use TypeScript.
1. [ ] Use React.
1. [ ] Use Redux for managing global states. [Check out](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Redux Saga for asynchronous side effects. [Check out](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/introduction/GettingStarted) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Vite for building the app.[Check out](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Material UI 5 for styling the application. [Check out](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) to get started.
1. [ ] Use Highcharts to display the plots. [Check out](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/index) to get started.

4 - Bonus
1. [ ] Add unit tests with Vitest. [Check out](https://vitest.dev/guide/) to get started.
1. [ ] Add e2e tests with Cypress. [Check out](https://learn.cypress.io/) to get started.
1. [ ] Deploy your application to a cloud provider and provide a link for the running app.

## Evaluation Criteria

Each one of the itens above will be evaluated as "Not Implemented", "Implemented with Issues", "Implemented", or "Implemented with Excellence". In order to assess different profiles and experiences, we expect candidates applying to more senior levels demonstrate a deeper understanding of the requirements and implement more of them in the same deadline.

In general we will be looking for the following:
1. [ ] Anyone should be able to follow the instructions and run the application.
1. [ ] Front-end code is successfully integrated with a fake REST API.
1. [ ] Stories were implemented according to the functional requirements.
1. [ ] Problem-solving skills and ability to handle ambiguity.
1. [ ] Code quality, readability, and maintainability.
1. [ ] Create reusable components.
1. [ ] The code is well-organized and documented.
1. [ ] The application layout is responsive.
